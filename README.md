There are three methods applied for hyperparameter tuning process, namely Bayesian Optimization, random search and genetic algorithm, respectively.
Bayesian Optimization and random search approaches are in file Bayesian_and_Random_.ipynb.
Genetic algorithm implementation is in file genetic.py and GA.ipynb.
